Fawna is an innovative mobile application designed to bridge the gap between digital connections and real-world interactions. In an era where technology often separates us, Fawna brings people together in meaningful ways.
Key Features:

Proximity-Based Connections: Using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology, Fawna helps you discover and connect with nearby users, encouraging face-to-face interactions in shared spaces.
Smart Chat Interface: Communicate with nearby users through a unique chat system featuring predefined messages, making it easy to break the ice and locate each other in crowded environments.
"Get to Know You" Questions: Once you've met someone, Fawna provides thoughtful questions to spark engaging conversations and deepen your connection.
Digital Tokens: Commemorate your real-world meetups with unique, generated digital tokens. These serve as mementos of your interactions and help build a visual network of your connections.
Privacy-Focused: Fawna prioritizes user privacy and security, giving you control over your visibility and the information you share.
Minimalist Design: With a clean, dark-mode interface, Fawna keeps the focus on real-world interactions rather than screen time.

Fawna is perfect for conferences, networking events, college campuses, or any situation where you want to make meaningful connections with people around you. It's more than just a social app â€“ it's a tool for building authentic relationships in the digital age.
